/**
 * CSVWriter handles the generation of CSV output files for DCI analysis results.
 * 
 * This class provides functionality to export DCI scores and coupling status
 * information to CSV format, enabling easy import into spreadsheet applications,
 * statistical analysis tools, and research software. The CSV output includes
 * comprehensive information for each service analyzed.
 * 
 * Output Format:
 * - Service: Name of the service
 * - DCI: RMT-based Dynamic Coupling Index score (0.0 to 1.0)
 * - Status: Human-readable coupling classification
 * 
 * The CSV format enables researchers and practitioners to:
 * - Import results into Excel, Google Sheets, or R/Python for analysis
 * - Create custom visualizations and reports
 * - Perform statistical analysis on coupling patterns
 * - Compare results across different systems or time periods

     * Write RMT-based DCI scores to CSV file for analysis and reporting.
     * 
     * This method generates a comprehensive CSV file containing DCI analysis
     * results for each service in the system. The output includes:
     * 
     * 1. Service names for identification
     * 2. DCI scores (formatted to 3 decimal places for precision)
     * 3. Coupling status classifications for quick interpretation
     * 
     * The CSV format is designed to be:
     * - Human-readable with clear column headers
     * - Compatible with common spreadsheet applications
     * - Suitable for statistical analysis and visualization
     * - Easy to process programmatically
     * 
     * Example output:
     * Service,DCI,Status
     * service-a,0.650,High Coupling
     * service-b,0.350,Moderate Coupling
     * service-c,0.100,Low Coupling

     * Get status classification for RMT DCI score.
     * 
     * This method provides a human-readable classification of coupling status
     * based on the RMT DCI score. The classification helps researchers and
     * practitioners quickly understand coupling patterns and identify potential
     * architectural concerns.
     * 
     * Classification thresholds are based on research and practical experience:
     * - High Coupling (â‰¥0.7): Service is highly dependent on many other services
     *   - Indicates potential architectural concerns
     *   - May need refactoring to reduce dependencies
     *   - Could be a bottleneck or single point of failure
     * 
     * - Moderate Coupling (0.4-0.7): Balanced coupling with reasonable dependencies
     *   - Generally acceptable coupling levels
     *   - Service has meaningful interactions without being overly dependent
     *   - Good balance between functionality and independence
     * 
     * - Low Coupling (0.0-0.4): Minimal coupling, potentially isolated
     *   - Service has few dependencies on other services
     *   - May be well-encapsulated or potentially underutilized
     *   - Could indicate good design or missed integration opportunities
     * 
     * - No Coupling (0.0): Completely isolated service
     *   - Service has no outgoing calls to other services
     *   - May be a standalone service or endpoint service
     *   - Could indicate architectural isolation or potential integration issues
     * 
     * These thresholds can be adjusted based on specific research needs or
     * organizational preferences for coupling management.
