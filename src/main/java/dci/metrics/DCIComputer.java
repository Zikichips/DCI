/**
 * DCIComputer implements the core Relative Measurement Theory (RMT) calculation
 * for Dynamic Coupling Index (DCI) computation.
 * 
 * This class provides the mathematical foundation for calculating coupling metrics
 * that are relative to the system context, enabling fair comparison across
 * different system sizes and architectures.
 * 
 * Key Concepts:
 * - RMT DCI = Actual_Couplings / Max_Possible_Couplings
 * - Actual Couplings: Number of unique services this service calls
 * - Max Possible Couplings: Total services in system minus 1 (can't call itself)
 * - Relative Measurement: Enables comparison across different system sizes
 * 
 * The RMT approach addresses the limitation of absolute coupling metrics by
 * providing a normalized measure that considers the system-wide context.

     * Computes RMT-based DCI for each service using Relative Measurement Theory.
     * 
     * This is the core method that implements the RMT formula for dynamic coupling
     * measurement. For each service in the system, it calculates:
     * 
     * RMT_DCI = Actual_Couplings / Max_Possible_Couplings
     * 
     * Where:
     * - Actual_Couplings: Number of unique services this service calls
     * - Max_Possible_Couplings: Total services in system minus 1
     * 
     * The result is a value between 0.0 and 1.0, where:
     * - 0.0 = No coupling (service calls no other services)
     * - 1.0 = Maximum coupling (service calls all other services)
     * - Values in between represent relative coupling strength
     * 
     * This relative approach enables fair comparison across systems of different sizes
     * and provides insights into coupling patterns that absolute metrics cannot.

     * 1. Count unique services this service calls (actual couplings)

     * - Isolated services (no outgoing calls) have DCI = 0.0
     * - Services calling all others have DCI = 1.0
     * - Relative measurement enables cross-system comparison
